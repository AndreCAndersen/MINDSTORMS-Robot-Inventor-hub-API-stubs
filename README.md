# Motivation

LEGO MINDSTORMS Python is a lot fun to play with! However, I don't like to be limited by the Lego IDE, and would rather develop using PyCharm.

This project aims to implements stubs and documentation for all of the classes and functions of the `mindstorms` library. It does NOT implement the actual underlying code, and does not make it possible to directly run your programs on your LEGO robot. You will still need to copy your code over to the LEGO MINDSTORMS app. Helper functions will be included to make this process less painful.
